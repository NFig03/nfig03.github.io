Working through this capstone has tied in all that I've learned in the Computer Science program and allowed me to refine my skills with various tools and frameworks. My experience in the Computer Science program has taught me essential soft skills for communicating with team members and stakeholders, as well as technical skills preparing me for a successful career in software engineering. 

Projects such as my Contact Service, text-based adventure game, and 3D workspace rendering, have allowed me to thoroughly refine my skills in languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I have also been able to work with frameworks such as Spring Boot, Angular, Node.js, Express, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, and NumPy for various course projects. Although I felt overwhelmed with the influx of information, it genuinely taught me how to work, think, learn, and adapt through a new fast-paced environment. I have also built a solid understanding of various database management systems including MongoDB and MySQL. Aside from technical work, I have learned development methods in collaborative environments such as Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall. 

Completing my work has helped me showcase these strengths as each deliverable contains an emphasis on a different topic such as data structures and algorithms or security features. For example, my text based adventure game and Contact Service programs each reinforced my knowledge of various data structures. My secure coding course, as well as various others, have taught me essential security skills such as domain validation, encryption, and input validation. Over time, these serve as great building blocks to a well rounded portfolio and skillset. This work has assisted me in determining the aspects of Computer Science that I am most fond of, and further formulated my goal of becoming a software engineer. 

These skills have provided me with a strong foundation to not only enter the computer science field, but also find great success with a smooth transition into it. This ePortfolio contains two artifacts which showcase my skills in software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, as well as databases. This ePortfolio and the upgrades to the artifacts, such as the database migration, implementation of secondary indices, and GUI addition, all showcase my versatility and competence within the realm of computer science. Collectively, these artifacts showcase a diverse skillset and emphasize specific topics which fit together forming this cohesive portfolio.

## Code Review: Core CS Concepts (Video)

In this video, I review two software artifacts I previously created and discuss planned enhancements. These updates are designed to demonstrate my competencies in software design, algorithms and data structures, and database management.

### Enhancement One

The artifact for enhancement one is a Contact Service program simulating a contact list in a cellular device. This program was initially created to learn and understand the concept of white-box unit testing with JUnit. The program began with a Contact and ContactService class along with their respective testing classes. Using a hash map, the program successfully created and stored contacts with query functionality limited to unique contact IDs. This enhancement improved the program by allowing for query by first name, which is far more aligned with real-world usage patterns. Even more significant in this enhancement is the implementation of a GUI. This addition transformed the program from a command line tool to a user friendly interface. Now users can physically interact with the program by adding, deleting, searching, and updating contacts.
