## Code Review: Core CS Concepts (Video)

In this video, I review two software artifacts I previously created and discuss planned enhancements. These updates are designed to demonstrate my competencies in software design, algorithms and data structures, and database management.

## [Contact Service Program](https://github.com/NFig03/CS-320-SoftwareTest-Automation)

### Enhancement One
The artifact for enhancement one is a Contact Service program simulating a contact list in a cellular device. This program was initially created to learn and understand the concept of white-box unit testing with JUnit. The program began with a Contact and ContactService class along with their respective testing classes. Using a hash map, the program successfully created and stored contacts with query functionality limited to unique contact IDs. This enhancement improved the program by allowing for query by first name, which is far more aligned with real-world usage patterns. Even more significant in this enhancement is the implementation of a GUI. This addition transformed the program from a command line tool to a user friendly interface. Now users can physically interact with the program by adding, deleting, searching, and updating contacts.
